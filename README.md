### Updates
<strong>Currently working on a RUST (lang) port of this (Lightweight), this branch is dead. I'll post the up to date branch soon.</strong>

### YES I KNOW IT
If you read through the code and see that I put in vuetify/vue/materialdesignicons through cdns instead of locally installing the packages and referencing them **I know it is like that and yes I will change it later on**.<br> I was way too burned out when writing the last parts of it that I couldn't bring myself to fix my issues with **Vuetify** by using it locally.

## Installation

Available through the [releases tab](https://github.com/lucthesloth/maplinkv2/releases)

##### Cert
You will most likely get some warnings when trying to install/run the app. This happens since I used a self-signed certificate for this app since I do not have enough money to get one from comodo or digicert (those things are expensive).
<br>If I get one later on it will be used but for now this is how it will be.

## Before Usage

## Maintenance
I will be actively maintaining this project to the best of my ability.
