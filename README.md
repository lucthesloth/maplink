### Updates
Currently the work on this project is stalled. I need to re-write the core components of it to fit <strong>SLOBS</strong> integration as well so I decided to rewrite everything properly using Typescript and VUE templating instead (Should've done this from the start)
<br>Without rewriting these parts of it I would be able to integrate slobs, yes, however for organization and ease of maintenance I will do it this way instead.
### YES I KNOW IT
If you read through the code and see that I put in vuetify/vue/materialdesignicons through cdns instead of locally installing the packages and referencing them **I know it is like that and yes I will change it later on**.<br> I was way too burned out when writing the last parts of it that I couldn't bring myself to fix my issues with **Vuetify** by using it locally.

## Installation

Available through the [releases tab](https://github.com/lucthesloth/maplinkv2/releases)

##### Cert
You will most likely get some warnings when trying to install/run the app. This happens since I used a self-signed certificate for this app since I do not have enough money to get one from comodo or digicert (those things are expensive).
<br>If I get one later on it will be used but for now this is how it will be.
