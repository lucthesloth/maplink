### YES I KNOW IT
If you read through the code and see that I put in vuetify/vue/materialdesignicons through cdns instead of locally installing the packages and referencing them **I know it is like that and yes I will change it later on**.<br> I was way too burned out when writing the last parts of it that I couldn't bring myself to fix my issues with **Vuetify** by using it locally.
